# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a classic game you can play with 2 people. You will be taking turns with player 1 and 2. A three in a row for one player is a win. If all the spaces had been filled up, the game will end in a draw. The bottom button resets the tic tact toe board to have a fresh clean slate.

Ideas to implement:
- Add an option of AI to the game
- Add different diffculties to the AI
- Add the score for the amount of wins player 1 and player 2 has recived.
- Make a way so the players can select their own icon that displays in the tic tac toe game
